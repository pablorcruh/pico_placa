PICO PLACA

Using object-oriented, tested code using JAVA and JUnit we create a  "pico y placa" predictor. The inputs should be a license plate number (the full number, not the last digit), a date (as a String), and a time, and the program will return whether or not that car can be on the road.

The project is a MAVEN project and can be imported to eclipse as existing maven project
The project has two packages one for the code implementing the logic and other for Junit testing
